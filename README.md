# Microsoft Azure IoT Suite 
You can deploy preconfigured solutions that implement common Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios to Microsoft Azure using your Azure subscription. You can use preconfigured solutions: 
- as a starting point for your own IoT solution. 
- to learn about the most common patterns in IoT solution design and development. 

Each preconfigured solution implements a common IoT scenario and is a complete, end-to-end implementation. You can deploy the Azure IoT Suite connected factory preconfigured solution from [https://www.azureiotsuite.com](https://www.azureiotsuite.com), following the guidance outlined in this [document](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/). In addition, you can download the complete source code from this repository to customize and extend the solution to meet your specific requirements. 

## Connected factory preconfigured solution
The connected factory preconfigured solution illustrates how you can get started with your Industrie 4.0 digital trnasformation. It brings together key Azure IoT services to enable the following features: OPC UA data ingestion, OPC UA server management, rules and actions and Azure Time Series Insights.
